          I&apos;m software engineer and full-stack developer based in Ukraine.
          I really like to solve technical problems and learn something new,
          that&apos;s why software isn&apos;t magic for me. I was working with many
          frameworks and different languages (java, js, python, shell, fish).

          I was working for web development for 8 years. My very first experience
          was with Java Spring (3.5) + SOAP. Some time later I started to learn javascript,
          especially angular 1 and I was working on a few projects written in angular 1.
          Few years later I&apos;ve started developing in python. My first project was about
          writing BE for FSFE (Free software foundation Europe) ldap + openid connect.
          And last few year untill now I&apos;m working with large django projects only.

          I used to work with high-level requirements and transform those into exact tasks
          needs to be done to achieve business goal. That&apos;s why I always pay attention
          to details on each level of CI/CD process (requirements clarification, scoping,
          estimating, implementing, testing, deploying to production).
